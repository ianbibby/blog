Looks like GopherCon 2018 was a great one in Denver, CO, with deep talks around implementing network protocols and ML too more general topics like how we structure our Go projects.

Maybe one day I'll get to attend one of these conferences in person, but for now I'll just have to plow through the playlist on Youtube!
